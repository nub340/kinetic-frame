Images in this folder are intended to be used for printing onto a canvas 13.5" x 52" in size and includes two copies of the same image. Cut them at the seam to make a 36" upper and a 16" lower canvas.

Form the upper 36" canvas into a loop/belt by gluing or sewing the top and bottom together. You want the loop/belt to be 36" in circumference, so don't overlap the actual printed portion. Use the non-printed margin for any overlap. Better yet, sew the two ends butted up against each other with no overlap at all.

It is recommended to glue the lower 16" canvas to cardstock or thick paper for durability and to prevent fraying. You can cut it shorter than 16" but you'll need to adjust the length of the fishing line to compensate.
